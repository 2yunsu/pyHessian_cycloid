      Summary
      </summary>  
      * AdaHessian is a new second order optimizer that uses Hessian diagonal to adaptively adjust gradient
      * The key idea is a novel inexact Newton method with variance reduction (RMS in time along with spatial averaging)
      * We perform extensive tests with modern Neural Networks for CV, NLP, and recommendation systems, and we achieve the best performance for all tasks as compared to other optimizers, even though they are tuned at industrial scale.
      * This is the first time that a second order method can exceed ADAM/SGD performance (and in fact with a large margin)
